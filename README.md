## üëÄ pH7Builder's Overview

**pH7 Dating CMS** is a **Social/Dating CMS** written in **Object-Oriented** PHP (*OOP*), fully compatible and highly optimised for PHP 7+ and based on **MVC** architecture (Model-View-Controller).

It is designed with the **KISS** principle in mind, and the whole source code can be read and understood in minutes. For a better flexibility, the software uses **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (no duplicate code) and **YAGNI** principle to avoid unused code/not needed functionality in the software.

This Free and Open Source **Social Dating Site Builder** wants to be low resource-intensive, powerful, stable and secure. The software also comes with 42 system modules and is based on **pH7Framework** *(written specifically for this project)* that has over 52 packages.

*To summarize, **pH7Builder** gives you **the perfect ingredients** to create the **best online dating service** or **social networking** website on the World Wide Web!*

## üèó Nginx Specification (configuration)

In order to get pH7Builder working on nginx server, you need to add some custom nginx configuration.

Create `/etc/nginx/ph7builder.conf` and add the following:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    index index.php;
}
```

*Please note that the above code is the strict minimum and obviously you can add more rules by comparing with the [main Apache .htaccess file](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7Builder/blob/master/.htaccess).*

Finally, in your nginx server configuration, you will have to include `ph7builder.conf` file to complete the configuration like below:

In file, e.g., *`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite.conf`* for Ubuntu and other OS based on Debian or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yoursite.conf` for CentOS and other OS based on Red Hat.

```nginx
server {
    # Port number. In most cases, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
    listen 80;

    server_name www.yoursite.com;
    root /var/www/ph7builder_public_root;
    index index.php; #you can use index.ph7; for hidding the *.php ...
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.access.log;

    # Include ph7builder.conf. You can also directly add the "location" rule instead of including the conf file
    include /etc/nginx/ph7builder.conf;
}
```

For more information, please refer to the nginx documentation.

## üå≤ pH7Builder; The Eco-Friendly CMS ‚ù§Ô∏è

![Eco Friendly. Love the World and Love the Nature](static/img/love-nature.svg)

[pH7Builder](https://ph7cms.com) has been built to reduce the power and CPU usage of your server in order to preserve the nature and help to save our environment.

pH7Builder's templates also use lighter colors since LCD monitors use less electricity to display them.
